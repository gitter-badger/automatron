![Automatron](docs/img/logo_huge.png)

Automatron **(Ah-Tom-a-tron)** is an open source framework designed to detect and remediate IT systems issues. Meaning, it can be used to monitor systems and when it detects issues; correct them.

* Automatically detect and add new systems to monitor
* Monitoring is executed over SSH and completely agent-less
* Policy based Runbooks allow for monitoring policies rather than server specific configurations
* Supports Nagios compliant health check scripts
* Allows arbitrary shell commands for both checks and actions
* Runbook flexibility with **Jinja2** templating support
* Pluggable Architecture that simplifies customization

## Runbooks

Automatron's actions are driven by policies called **Runbooks**. These runbooks are used to define what health checks should be executed on a target host and what to do about those health checks when they fail.

### A simple Runbook

The below example is a Runbook that will execute a monitoring plugin to determine the amount of free space on `/var/log` and based on the results execute a corrective action.

```yaml
name: Verify /var/log
schedule: "*/2 * * * *"
nodes:
  - "*"
checks:
  mem_free:
    # Check for the % of disk free create warning with 20% free and critical for 10% free
    execute_from: ontarget
    type: plugin
    plugin: systems/disk_free.py
    args: --warn=20 --critical=10 --filesystem=/var/log
actions:
  logrotate_nicely:
    execute_from: ontarget
    trigger: 0
    frequency: 300
    call_on:
      - WARNING
    type: cmd
    cmd: bash /etc/cron.daily/logrotate
  logrotate_forced:
    execute_from: ontarget
    trigger: 5
    frequency: 300
    call_on:
      - CRITICAL
    type: cmd
    cmd: bash /etc/cron.daily/logrotate --force
```

### A Runbook with Jinja2

Jinja2 support was added to Runbooks to allow for extensive customization. The below example shows using Jinja2 to determine which `cmd` to execute based on Automatron's **facts** system.

This example will detect if `nginx` is running and if not, restart it.

```yaml
name: Verify nginx is running
schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
nodes:
  - "*web*"
checks:
  nginx_is_running:
    # Check if nginx is running
    execute_from: ontarget
    type: cmd
    {% if "Linux" in facts['os'] %}
    cmd: service nginx status
    {% else %}
    cmd: /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nginx status
    {% endif %}
actions:
  restart_nginx:
    execute_from: ontarget
    trigger: 2
    frequency: 300
    call_on:
      - WARNING
      - CRITICAL
    type: cmd
    {% if "Linux" in facts['os'] %}
    cmd: service nginx restart
    {% else %}
    cmd: /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nginx restart
    {% endif %}
```
